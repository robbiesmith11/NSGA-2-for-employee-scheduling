constraints: (using ORtools)
-maxium shifts per employee a day <= 1
-every employee meets min and max hours
-schedule meets employees availability
-schedule meets group demand per day

Optimise: (using NSGA-2)
-minimise hours to potentially their min
-maximise skilled individuals on shift per day

Final Steps:
more numba + vectorisation on the mutation functions
learning rate function 
break local optima function
